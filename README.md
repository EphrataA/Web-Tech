Note on html :-
           HTML is the most basic building block of the web. It defines the meaning and structure of a web content.  In our lecture we have seen some of the basic html codes, with their attributes and properties. We have seen how to create an index files with headers and paragraphs. We have also seen some attributes for styling elements. To mention some of them, they are font styles and font size. How to color our html texts, which is simply to add a style attribute to the text element we want to color and use the color property. When we want to embed an image in a web page, we use the html tag <img>. Images are not inserted in a web page but they are linked to it.
          We can also link other websites using a clickable hyperlinks. The <link> tag is used to link your current file with an external resource. Another important code we have seen is the ordered and unordered list. By using the ol and ul tag we can create listed items. Each list items start with the li tag. 

  
Note on python :-
           Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software. Python is a general purpose language so it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn’t specialized for any specific problems. We tried to see some basic codes here as well. The first one we saw is the print function that basically prints the specified parameter to the screen. The parameter can be a string, or any other object. The other one is the sep= parameter which separate the objects, if there is more than one. 
            Another function we saw is the user input function. The input() function receives the user input and stores it into variable name. we also learned about datatypes lists and sequences in python. We’ve seen how to write a list of numbers and to print out the length of numbers to insert numbers in the middle of lists. How to write tuple of numbers and a set of numbers. Another lesson we saw is conditions. Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics. 


Note on portfolio :-
        In my portfolio I included several bootstrap HTML codes starting from  a navigation bar and a carousel. There is also embedded images and buttons as well. The nav bar is responsive so for smaller devices like a phone for example, it can get smaller to fit the phone and for larger devices it expands to fit the screen. The same goes for all the contents in the website. This concept is related to rows and columns.  
       A responsive web design is about a web page that fits right on all devices(desktops, tables, and phones). It will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewport. This website is mostly built using bootstrap. It has a responsive 12 column grids and layouts, which is the default grid system.

Note on quote generator :-
      This is a website that generates a different movie quote every time we refresh or click a button that will change the quote. In this project I used HTML, CSS and Java script. The java script run on several website so we create an external java script file, instead of writing the same script over and over again. We save the script file with a .js extension, and then refer to it using the src attribute in the <script> tag. 
-	HTML is to define the content of the web page
-	CSS is to specify the layout of web pages
-	JavaScript is to program the behavior of web page
